## Summary
```
The entire data analysis consists of two parts: the first part involves conducting basic two-sample Mendelian Randomization using the TwoSampleMR R package, and the second part involves performing a meta-analysis using the metafor R package to estimate the overall causal effects of Toxoplasma gondii infection on various psychiatric diseases. 
```
## Data source
```
All summary-level GWAS datasets are openly accessible from the website (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/) mentioned in the main paper (Method section). Four methods for estimating causal effects were employed in our research, with the IVW method providing the primary outcome in this paper.
```
## Meta_Analysis
```
The meta-analysis leveraged information prodeuced from the MR analyses to comprehensively evaluate the overall effects on various psychiatric diseases and test the heterogeneity of the results.
